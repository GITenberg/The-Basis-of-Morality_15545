description: Must religion and morals go together? Can one be taught without the other?
  It is a practical question for educationists, but apart from education, the question
  of the bedrock on which morals rest, the foundation on which a moral edifice can
  be built that will stand secure against the storms of life?that is a question of
  perennial interest, and it must be answered by each of us, if we would have a test
  of Right and Wrong, would know why Right is Right, why Wrong is Wrong. Mysticism
  cannot be spoken of as a basis of morality in the sense in which Revelation, Intuition,
  Utility and Evolution are.
